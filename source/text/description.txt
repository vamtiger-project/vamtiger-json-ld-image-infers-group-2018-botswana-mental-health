The artwork represents anxiety and depression.

The person’s world is broken, as shown by the
torn Earth in the lower left corner.

Although he wears a smiling face, it’s just a
mask with a crack in it, hiding his true feelings.

He is self-medicating with cigarettes and pills
to try to make himself feel better, and he is
floating in space, in his own world.
The sunflower sun represents the role nature plays
in helping with depression, like taking a walk
outside, etc.

The rocket shoes represent his efforts to uplift
himself despite his struggles.
